Efficiency Analysis:

Compare the length of rows in matrix one and make sure it equals the length of columns in matrix two.

Count the three for loops (loops through m1Rows, m2Columns, and m2Rows).

Input size n equals the length of row a and q equals the length of column b.
If the input size is large then the run time will be longer.
The worst case in Big-Oh: O(a*b*c).
